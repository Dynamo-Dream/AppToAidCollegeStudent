**Idea and Approach:**

Our project revolves around the creation of two distinct yet interconnected apps sharing a single database:

1. **Admin App:** This app is accessible to professors and job posters. It allows them to post job listings and research topics for college students to apply to. Professors and employers can also shortlist and manage applicants.
2. **Student App:** This app is specifically tailored for college students and is divided into four key components:
    
    a. **Job and Research Listings:** Students can browse recent job and research opportunities posted by faculty members and potential employers. They can apply directly from the app by providing relevant information.
    
    b. **Student Loan Comparison:** Students can compare various student loan policies offered by different banks, enabling them to choose the one that best suits their needs.
    
    c. **Community Portal:** This section allows students to post their needs or problems, which are visible to all app users. If someone can provide assistance, they can connect and help each other. For instance, a student in need of a specific medication can post their request here.
    
    d. **Task Management Portal:** This feature helps students organize their tasks efficiently using the Eisenhower Matrix, ensuring they prioritize important tasks and maintain a healthy work-life balance. Tasks can be uploaded, managed, and accessed at any time to stay on top of deadlines.
